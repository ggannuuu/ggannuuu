## 💡 About Me

I’m passionate about building intelligent robotic systems that navigate dynamic environments. My academic journey and hands-on research have centered around:

- **Motion Planning** and **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**
- **L1 Adaptive Control** and real-time optimization
- **Sensor Fusion** using Lidar and Ultra-Wideband (UWB)
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance** in simulation and hardware
- **Embedded Systems** with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi
- **Autonomous Driving Algorithms** and path prediction

From simulating obstacle-aware trajectories to deploying embedded controllers for real-world robots, I thrive at the intersection of mechanical design and intelligent control.
